# 8086 Toolchain

This is the C-based 8086 toolchain for BYU ECEn 425 (Real Time Operating
Systems). This repo also includes [an archive of the class website][4],
including all the homework, labs, documentation, and lectures from the class.

The toolchain was taken directly from `/ee2/ee425/src/dist` on the BYU CAEDM
computers.

**Disclaimer:** For ECEn 425 projects, this may or may not compile exactly the same as the CAEDM machines


**Prerequisites to build toolchain:**

* Linux:
  * On Debian based systems (Ubuntu, etc.), run the following in your terminal:
  `sudo apt-get install gcc-multilib g++-multilib libc6-dev-i386 lib32ncurses5-dev xterm`
  * *Tested on Ubuntu 16.04 x86_64, Ubuntu 17.04 x86_64, Ubuntu 17.10, and Ubuntu 22.04 (regular and WSL)*

* Mac OS X:
  * Your system will depend on the X11 Window system, which is now called
  XQuartz. It can be found [here](http://xquartz.macosforge.org/).
  * *Tested with XQuartz 3.7.7 on Mac OS X Yosemite.*

**Building on Linux/Mac:**

`cd` into the cloned repo and run `make`:

```bash
$ cd ~/8086-toolchain/
$ make
```

This will create 5 binaries in the `./bin/` directory:

* `c86` - The 8086 compiler
* `emu86` - The 8086 emulator
* `nasm` - The 8086 assembler
* `ndisasm` - The 8086 disassembler
* `ProgramCRT` - The terminal program used by emu86 to display Simptris.

 If there are any problems, you can try `cd`ing into each of the tool
 directories and running make individually so you can see the warnings/errors more clearly.

To use the binaries from anywhere, see **Setting Your Path** below.

### Setting Your Path ###

To use the binaries from anywhwere, modify your `PATH` at the bottom of your
`~/.profile` or `~/.bashrc` (or whatever your shell's startup script is):

```bash
# 8086 Toolchain
export PATH="$HOME/8086-toolchain/bin":$PATH
```

Reload your shell's startup by either closing your shell and reopening it, or using the `source` command:

```bash
source ~/.profile
# Or
source ~/.bashrc
```

This will add your toolchain bin to `PATH` in the current terminal.

## Common Problems ##

**Linux:**
+ `cdefs` not defined: Make sure Linux prereqs are installed
+ Parsing errors with Perl generated headers/macros: At some point the files were saved with 'DOS' line endings instead of Unix, so if you see a `^M` (Windows carriage return char) that is likely the issue and saving (or overwriting) the file correctly should fix it. Make sure to blow away any generated files.
+ If on Ubuntu 17.04 or higher, you may get the following error: `xterm: cannot load font '-misc-fixed-medium-r-semicondensed--13-120-75-75-c-60-iso10646-1'`. emu86 will still work fine. If you wish to fix the error, you can try following the steps in this form:  http://forum.porteus.org/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=1013


**Mac:**
+ `cpp` does not remove `//` comments correctly: See Makefile example below, make sure to add `-xc++` flag to `cpp` to remove c99 style comments.

### Makefile Example ###

```Makefile
lab1.bin:       lab1final.s
                nasm lab1final.s -o lab1.bin -l lab1.lst  # Step 4, Assemble

lab1final.s:    clib.S lab1asm.S lab1.s
                cat clib.S lab1asm.S lab1.s > lab1final.s # Step 3, Concatenate

lab1.s:         lab1.c
                cpp -xc++ lab1.c lab1.i    # Step 1, Preprocess
                c86 -g lab1.i lab1.s       # Step 2, Compile

clean:
                rm lab1.bin lab1.lst lab1final.s lab1.s lab1.i

test:
                emu86 lab1.bin
```

**Makefile error:** If you copy this directly and paste into a Makefile, the tabs will often be converted to spaces. You will get a "Missing separator" error from make. Just replace the indentions with two tabs and it should work.


## Website ##

The ECEn 425 website is stored in directory `website/` and
contains lab instructions, 8086 resources, homework assignments, and class
slides.

### Browsing the website ##

The class website is [currently hosted via GitHub pages here][4]. The original
site is also [available on Wayback Machine][2].

Optionally, you can browse all the files locally by pointing your web broswer to
the file `website/index.html`, and all the links should work.

Another option is to host the website locally. In a terminal, do:

```shell
cd website/
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then, access the local website in your browser at `localhost:8000`.
This option is nice because it allows Chrome extensions (like DarkReader) to
work (Chrome extensions are not allowed to run on local file paths).

### Updating the website hosted by GitHub pages

To update the class website hosted by GitHub pages, first install the
[`ghp-import`][5] Python module:

```bash
pip install ghp-import
```

Then, simply run `scripts/gh-pages-import.sh`. This will overwrite the
`gh-pages` branch of this repo with the current contents of the `website/`
directory.

### Website history

After Dr. Archibald retired in August 2020, the BYU ECEn department
discontinued ECEn 425. At some point in 2022, BYU also stopped hosting
[the original class website][1]. Luckily,
[the class website was archived by Wayback Machine][2], and the website was
saved to this repo on 2023-05-03 using [this tool][3].
